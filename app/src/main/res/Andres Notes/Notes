How do I save my project to github?

To save your project to GitHub, you will need to create a repository for your project and then push your local code to the repository. Here is a summary of the steps you need to follow:

Go to GitHub and sign in to your account.
Click the "+" icon in the top right corner, and select "New repository".
Give your repository a name and a brief description, and select "Create repository".
Open a terminal window, navigate to the root directory of your project, and run the following commands:

[ cd C:\Users\andre\AndroidStudioProjects\MADSkills ]

Copy code
git init
[Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/andre/AndroidStudioProjects/MADSkills/.git/]
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
These commands will initialize a Git repository in your project, add all the files in your project to the repository, and create an initial commit.

Next, you need to add the GitHub repository as a remote for your local repository. To do this, run the following command, replacing <username> with your GitHub username and <repository> with the name of your repository:
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Finally, push your local repository to the GitHub repository by running the following command:
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This will push your code to the master branch of the repository on GitHub. If you want to push to a different branch, you can specify the name of the branch after origin, like this:

Copy code
git push -u origin <branch-name>
